## Color codes work here and {PLAYER} is the player name.
## Also the death messages can be used for regular mobs
## such as creepers when using their proper name
## Their name is usually the same, but capitalized.
## Creeper = CREEPER | Zombie =  ZOMBIE | and so on...

## To create a death message the format is as such
## - {ENTITY} - {DeathMessage} or
## - CREEPER - {PLAYER} was killed by a Creeper.
